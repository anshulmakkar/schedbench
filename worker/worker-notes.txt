Apparently rumpkernels don't handle stdin from console; need another
way of conveying information.

Options:

- Continue to pursue alternate routes
 - xenstore
 - config files
 - rumprun command-line

- Just hard-code a single example (or a couple of typical ones) for
  now, work on control & reporting daemon

Notes:

- xenstore access is available for "kernel-side" things, but not
  really for "user-side" things; proper access might actually require
  re-porting libxenstore.a (and its prerequisites) into the rumpkernel
  userspace.   This seems like a bit of a silly duplication.
